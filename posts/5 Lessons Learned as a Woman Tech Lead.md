I am a woman. I am a developer. I’ve been working in tech for 11 years. I started working as a developer in Italy, and after 6 years I moved to Paris to pursue my ambition of becoming a technical leader. Two years ago I had the opportunity to face the challenge I had been waiting for: I got offered a Tech Lead role at Dashlane.

At Dashlane, a Tech Lead coordinates technical tasks such as evaluating the feasibility, cost, and general architecture for the implementation of a feature. We coordinate technical communication across platforms and ensure junior developers are properly onboarded to technical projects.

As soon as I secured the title that I was aiming at, I started freaking out. It was my first time in this role, and I didn’t know where to start. I was named tech lead in a team where I had joined just 6 months before, with talented and more experienced people. Moreover, I was taking over the role from a colleague that was still part of the team.

My impostor syndrome flared up with a vengeance. And that led me to a series of mistakes and misconceptions over my role-mistakes that I believe made me a better tech lead today. These are few of the tips I would tell myself if I could turn back time.

I recently shared them during a webinar for 50inTech.

## Trust your team

One of the skills that got me into this role was my vocality. I have always spoken up, stood up for my ideas, and pushed to reach the finish line.

My first mistake was to think that as a tech lead I was expected to keep pushing for my ideas. To be the expert in the room. To always come up with the best solution. My imposter syndrome played a big role in this misconception, whispering that I was not worthy to be in my role. And that made me try even harder to be the one with the best idea-always.

A mentor once told me I was a leader because I was a control freak. But once you become a leader, you need to let it go. Loosen your control. Listen and trust your team. And that put me out of my comfort zone.

I learned the lesson the hard way: one of my senior colleagues wanted to test a technology I didn’t like. He had to ping me for months before I finally let him work on a proof of concept. And it worked. I put both of us in an awkward situation and let him feel unheard. That taught me to listen more carefully to my team, and to always criticize my own ideas. In tech it’s hard to find a perfect solution, there are always pros and cons. Learning to find both strong and weak points is hard but will improve collaboration within your team. Showing the vulnerability in your thoughts is a way to ensure psychological safety and will let your less vocal team members feel comfortable with coming with alternatives. And that’s the way to the best solution.
