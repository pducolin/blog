As listed in the [intro](https://www.poladuco.com/Making-of-a-blog-intro), I created this blog using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

I followed [this incredibly well done tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/05/04/building-a-markdown-blog-with-next-9.4-and-netlify/) by [Cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) on Netflify's blog.

Following are more details and the rationale behind each choice.

## React

I picked React because I was already familiar with it, having used it for work and personal projects.

## Markdown

Markdown is another language I am familiar with as I use it to document code within its repository as it is supported and formatted by Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket. It takes a bit of time to get to know the [syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is made of ~10 elements, tiny but powerfull.

When I write posts I generally need paragraphs, [titles](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers), [images](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images), [code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code-and-syntax-highlighting) and sometimes [lists](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists). Most of the time I would go and check the cheatsheet, no need to know them by heart.

VSCode supports Markdown preview, and I recommend adding [Markdown lint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint).

## Next.js

Next.js is a framework to build React applications. It has a zero-configuration compilation and bundling setup that makes it handy to start with. I chose it because it was used in the tutorial I used, but I dug into it to understand how it works.

It requires a folder named `pages` that will contain the list of pages of the website as React components. The first super power of Next.js is that it supports file-system routing, meaning that requests to `yourwebsite.com` will load the default `index.js`, and requests to `yourwebsite.com/about` will route to `about.js`. Cool, isn't it?

Being pure React components, pages can use other components to create more or less complex structures.

You can argue that a blog is made of pages dynamically created based on a list of posts, that in my case are a list of `md` files. Second power, Next.js supports **server-side** dynamic pages creation: at build time it creates one page component for each Markdown file from a specific folder, using `[postname].jsx` as a schema.

![This project's posts folder containing 2 files, index.js and about.js, plus a post folder][pages_folder]

*This project has 2 pages (`index.js` and `about.js`) and, post folder*

It took me some time to understand what **server-side** vs **static** vs **client-side* rendering meant and how Next.js works under the hood. [Rendering on the web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web) from Google developers blog explains in details all different renderings.

In my pages I use [getStaticProps](https://github.com/pducolin/blog/blob/main/pages/post/%5Bpostname%5D.jsx#L80) and [getStaticPaths](https://github.com/pducolin/blog/blob/main/pages/post/%5Bpostname%5D.jsx#L96) to get dynamic informations, such as the list of post names. These two functions are called by Next at **build time** and used to pre-render Javascript pages using the props returned.

By running `next build && next export` the magic happens, and next generates the HTML static pages:

![This project's out folder with build time, static html pages][out_folder]

And this is even cooler, as client's browser will download the HTML already rendered, no React manipulating the DOM.

## React + Next.js + Markdown = ‚ù§Ô∏è

Here's how to mix the React, Next.js and Markdown together to obtain a blog post page in 3 steps

1Ô∏è‚É£  I create a markdown blog post and save it in `posts` folder. Note how I pass title, hero image and date metadata info using the frontmatter at the top of the markdown file

```md

Organic banh mi keytar shaman trust fund, pok pok cliche. Williamsburg shoreditch prism, green juice disrupt blog tbh retro hexagon waistcoat before they sold out biodiesel godard ethical.
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ I fetch the markdown content using Next.js's `getStaticProps` from `[postname].jsx`:

```js
export async function getStaticProps({ ...ctx }) {
  const { postname } = ctx.params
  const content = await import(`../../posts/${postname}.md`)
  const config = await import(`../../siteconfig.json`)
  const data = matter(content.default)
  return {
    props: {
      siteTitle: config.title,
      frontmatter: data.data,
      markdownBody: data.content
    }
  }
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ I pass the markdown body to React Markdown as child:

```jsx
<ReactMarkdown>{markdownBody}</ReactMarkdown>
```

That's it! Running:

```bash
# dev mode
yarn dev
# or prod mode
yarn build && yarn export
```

will generate one page per markdown file üéâ

Next post will be about the design, from picking colors to TailwindCss and @tailwindcss/typography. Stay tuned!
