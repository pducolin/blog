I have 3 big passions: software development, cooking and sport. What do these 3 have in commmon? They can all be planned. Cooking have recipes and ingredients list to buy, sport challenges require a training plan. Being a bit of a control freak I love planning, and I love keeping track of how I made something. So here's my journey through this blog.
